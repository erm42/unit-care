# Welcome to Unit Care!

Turns out, units are important!

Yeah, quantum chemists. Even you need to tell us what your units are.

Add sincerity here. But also sass.

## Hey friend, need an SSH key?
From your local machine terminal (use Git Bash if on Windows!!!), run the following (replace with your GitHub email account)
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Choose the default location for the key files to be generated,
then run the command:
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy and paste this public key (including the email address) into your GitHub SSH key manager:
1. Click your profile icon, then go to **Settings**
2. Go to **SSH and GPG keys**
3. Click on the green **New SSH key** button
4. Paste public key from `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
5. Save by clicking the green **Add SSH key** button
